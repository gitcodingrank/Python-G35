#List: it is a data structure which is used to store collection of data.
#Variable: it is also data structure

#Why List?
"""
-in the case of variable there is one limitation, your variable can only store one value at a time.

Example: store 10 int type value.
var1 = 10
var2 = 11
var3 = 12
var4 = 13
var5 = 14
var6 = 15
var7 = 16
var8 = 17
var9 = 18
var10 = 19

What if you want to store 100 value of same type?
-Then you need to declare 100 variables.

Note: variable is the best choice if you want to use it in the following cases:
1. less number of data of different type.
2. if you want to store one value at a time.

Question: Then if we have number of data of same type then what is the data structure need to use?

Solution: List/Array
List: it is a data structure which is used to store collection/set of data of same type(homogenous) or differnt type(hatrogenous).
"""

#Declaration of List:
"""
syntax:

variable_name = []

Note: You can store list of data in single variable.
"""

# names = []
# print(names) #[]

#Initialization/adding/storing the data in List:
"""
there are following ways to add data to the array.
2. using append(data), insert(index, data)

Note: List follows 0 based indexing, meaning that the first value/element/item in the list will be at  index 0 and so on.
"""
# numbers =  []

#using append(data): it adds the data at the end of array.
#array_name.append(data)

# numbers.append(45)
# numbers.append(46)
# print(numbers)

#add number from 1 to 20 to the List.

# for i in range(1, 21):
#   numbers.append(i)

# print(numbers)
