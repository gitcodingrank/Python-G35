# #Examples: run your loop from 1 to 10 and break the running loop at 5


# #Example 1:
# # sp = 1

# # while sp<=10:

# #     if sp==5:
# #         break
# #     print(sp)
    
# #     sp+=1

# #Example 2:
# sp = 1

# while sp<=10:

#     print(sp)

#     if sp==5:
#         break
    
#     sp+=1
