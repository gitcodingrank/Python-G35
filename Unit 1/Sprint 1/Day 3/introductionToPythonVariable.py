#Variable: it is like a container/box which is used to store technical data.
#Technical Data: it is the combination of Numbers, and Words

#Numbers: 1. Integer Numbers(+ve(1,2,3,4,45,34), -ve(-10,-20,-30)) 2. Decimal Number(34.56, 890.78)
#Real Life Examples: age = 23, orders = 45, salary = 98989.890, avgSalary = 45343.34

#Words(Strings): it is collection of characters(numbers + letters + special symbols) enclosed with single('') and double quatation marks("")
#Real Life Examples: name = "Bob"/'Bob', city = "Haryana", username = "bob@123", pincode = "201301", password = "bob@12345"


#Declaration/creating of variable

# name = "Bob"
# age = 45

#Note: at the time of creating variable, it is important to initialize/store the value/data to id.

#How to store value to variable: using = (sing/operator) : assignment operator
#Example varibale_name = 45

#how to check, what is particular variable is containing/holding
#print(): it is like a tool which is used to print data inside variable on console.
#Examples: print(variable_name)

#print(name) # Bob

# city = "Noida"
# ##print(city)

# print(name, city)


#Rules for taking valid variable name

#1. Start with a letter or underscore (_)

#1name #invalid variable name as it is starting with number
#$age #invalid variable name as it is starting with doller sign
# name # valid variable name as it is starting with letter.
# FatherName #valid variable name as it is starting with letter.
# _name #valid variable name as it is starting with underscore.

#2. Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.

# name1 #valid variable name as it is containing letters and numeber
# name 1 #invalid varibale  name as it is containing space
# first_name #valid variable name as it is containing underscore and letter.

#3. Case-sensitive, myVar, and myvar are considered different variables.

#4. Avoid using Python-reserved words as variable names like while, if, and 

#Note: because these python keywords have its own functionality.

#class #invalid variable name as it python pre-defined word which has sepecific functionality
# if #invalid variable name as it python pre-defined word which has sepecific functionality in python
# If #valid variable name as it is not pre-defined/reservered word

#5. Variable need to be initialized/stored by value at the time of declaration/creating.

# print("-***---***-----***---***-----***---***-----***---***----")
# print("|                 Chitkara University                   |")
# print("|-------------------------------------------------------|")
# print("|              Name      :   Bob                        |")
# print("|              Degree    : Becholor of Engineering      |")
# print("-***---***-----***---***-----***---***-----***---***----")
